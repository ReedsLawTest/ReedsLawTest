        <p class="definition">
            <strong>Reed's Law</strong> <span class="pronunciation">/rēds lô/</span> <em>noun</em><br>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> A principle stating that there exists a critical point (or line) on a conceptual continuum of behaviors associated with sexual orientation. 
            As an individual approaches this critical point from a predominantly heterosexual orientation by engaging in behaviors typically associated with homosexuality, 
            their orientation appears to become increasingly heterosexual in contrast. However, upon surpassing this critical point, the relationship inverts; the individual's 
            orientation rapidly shifts towards homosexuality, akin to a mathematical limit where the function yields different values depending on the direction from which the 
            limit is approached.
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            <strong>In formal terms:</strong> If we let `x` represent the degree of "gayness" (behavioral actions associated with homosexuality), and `y` represent the corresponding perceived sexual orientation:
            <ul>
                <li>As `x` approaches the critical point `c` from the left (`x → c⁻`), `y` increases towards heterosexuality.</li>
                <li>As `x` passes the critical point `y` rapidly increases towards homosexuality.</li>
            </ul>
            This creates a discontinuity at `x = c`, where the perceived orientation flips from one extreme to the other, analogous to a piecewise function with distinct behaviors on either side of the critical point.
